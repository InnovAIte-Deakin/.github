# Welcome to InnovAIte!

Welcome to InnovAIte, a School of IT Capstone Company aimed at trialing and validating AI tools and methods for the 2026 launch of **SPARK**, a student-led AI-powered entrepreneurship platform at Deakin University. We're excited to have you on board to help validate and prototype the core components of Australia's first AI-native startup engine.

Our mission is to understand how AI tools and platforms can dramatically compress startup development cycles from months to days, making entrepreneurship more accessible to everyone regardless of their technical background.

## Our Structure

At InnovAIte, we operate with a collaborative structure that encourages team leadership and contributions from all students. We are assisted by a dedicated team of staff and industry mentors:

*   **Dr. Bahadorreza Ofoghi** - Company Director & Product Owner, AAIE
*   **Jessie McMeikan** - Product Owner, AI Generalist Program, AI Prototyping Lab & AI Organisation Design
*   **Ian Jones** - Product Owner, AI Assisted Navigation Device & Venture Pipeline Management System
*   **Scott West** - Industry Mentor, AI Generalist Program & AI Prototyping Lab
*   **Leo Bruzzaniti** - Industry Mentor, AI Organisation Design
*   **Nebula Alam** - Industry Mentor, AAIE
*   **Jayamini De Silva** - Industry Mentor, Venture Pipeline Management System & AI Assisted Navigation Device

## Our Operations: "The Three C's"

Our company operates on three core principles: **Code**, **Communication**, and **Coordination**.

### 1. Code
We use GitLab as our central code repository. All project repositories are housed in our company-wide GitLab group.

*   **GitLab Link**: **https://gitlab.deakin.edu.au/innovaite** (Sign in with Deakin SSO)
*   **Code Integration Leads**: JAY SHRIMPTON, POOJA DISSANAYAKE
*   **Responsibilities**: Our Code Leads manage our repositories, evaluate AI coding tools, establish best practices, and manage the handoff between AI-generated code and human refinement.

### 2. Communication
We use Microsoft Teams for all direct communication, updates, and event announcements.

*   **Comms Leads**: Thomas Fleming, AHMAD TAHIR CHAUDHRY, ALBERT JULIANTO
*   **Responsibilities**: Our Comms Leads manage the flow of information, handle company-wide OnTrack submissions, and are encouraged to explore technical contributions.

### 3. Coordination
We use Microsoft Planner as our single source of truth for project management and task tracking.

*   **Sprint Leads**: ARNAV AHUJA, ANDREW PAULL, AGAM AGARWAL
*   **Responsibilities**: Our Sprint Leads challenge traditional agile frameworks by adapting them for rapid AI-driven development. They manage project backlogs, coordinate sprints, and document findings on how to best manage "Vibe Coded" workflows.

> **A Note on Leadership**: Our leads are students just like you, volunteering their time to take on extra responsibilities. They don't have all the answers and are building their portfolios too. Please be respectful and, most importantly, **help your leads by making contributions**. Being a lead is not enough; you must demonstrate your leadership through genuine and impactful contributions.

## Our Projects (Trimester 2 2025)

This trimester, InnovAIte is running 6 core validation projects as part of our SPARK 2026 preparation.

### 1. AI Generalist Program
This program focuses on equipping non-technical users with the knowledge and tools to effectively use AI in academic and professional settings.
*   **Last Trimester's Achievements**: The team conducted extensive research into generative AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude), developed educational toolkits, and created instructional videos and workshops. Key outputs included a functional AI-powered thesis statement generator, a personalized research assistant web app, and an AI attribution manager tool. They successfully ran workshops with Deakin staff and students to validate the tools and gather feedback.

### 2. AI Prototyping Lab
This lab explores the rapid, hands-on development of AI-powered tools to test how AI can significantly compress startup development timelines.
*   **Last Trimester's Achievements**: Students built and tested several Minimum Viable Products (MVPs). Key projects included the **NoCodeJam.AI** hackathon platform, the official **InnovAIte Website**, the **Skill Quest Sprint** 30-day challenge platform, and a collaborative platform named **CollabHub AI**. The focus was on practical application, testing tool limits, and creating functional prototypes from scratch.

### 3. Artificial Assessment Intelligence for Educators (AAIE) (New!)
AAIE is a three-year initiative to develop a domain-specific LLM to assist educators with AI-aware assessment. Students will be grouped into specialized teams focusing on rubric simulation, mini-LLM prototyping, and use-case design, with a final goal of integrating with systems like CloudDeakin and OnTrack.

### 4. AI Assisted Navigation Device (New!)
In collaboration with Mekong Inclusive Ventures (MIV), this project aims to prototype an AI-powered assistive navigation device for people with disabilities. Using camera-based systems and object detection, the device will provide real-time feedback to help users navigate their environment safely and effectively.

### 5. Venture Pipeline Management System (New!)
This project focuses on designing a venture pipeline tracking system to support the growth of inclusive businesses in Southeast Asia. The goal is to prototype a tool (using Airtable, Notion, or a custom build) to help MIV manage startups from diagnostics to investment readiness.

### 6. AI Organisation Design (New!)
This project explores how AI can enhance organizational workflows. Students will develop frameworks for responsible AI integration and investigate building user-friendly, AI-enhanced planning tools, with a major ambition to create an AI-powered project planner that outperforms existing services.
