# Welcome to InnovAIte
### The AI-Powered Startup Engine at Deakin University

**InnovAIte** is a student-led Capstone Company at Deakin University, dedicated to trialing and validating the AI tools, methods, and frameworks that will power **SPARK**â€”Australia's first AI-native startup engine, launching in 2026.

Our mission is to understand and demonstrate how AI can dramatically compress startup development cycles from months to days. By doing so, we aim to make entrepreneurship radically more accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical background.

## Our Core Programs

We operate through two foundational programs designed to explore the full spectrum of AI's potential in an entrepreneurial context.

### ðŸŽ“ AI Generalist Program
This program focuses on equipping non-technical users with the practical skills to leverage AI effectively. Through research and workshops, we create educational resources that demystify AI for academic and professional use.

*   **Key Focus Areas**: Generative AI for academic writing, AI-enhanced teaching tools, administrative automation, and prompt engineering fundamentals.
*   **Key Outputs**: We have developed functional prototypes like an AI-powered **Thesis Generator** (using Cohere), a personalized **Research Assistant web app**, and a tool for managing **AI attribution**.

### ðŸ’» AI Prototyping Lab
This lab is a hands-on incubator for rapidly developing and testing AI-powered applications. We build Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) to prove how AI can accelerate the journey from idea to a functional prototype.

*   **Key Outputs**: We have successfully built and deployed several platforms, including:
    *   **[NoCodeJam.AI](http://nocodejam.ai/)**: A live platform for hosting AI-assisted no-code hackathons.
    *   **[InnovAIte Website](https://innovalte-deakin.web.app/)**: The central hub for our company, built with a Supabase backend.
    *   **Socratic Crumbs**: A multimodal chatbot with voice and vision capabilities for enhanced learning.
    *   **[Skill Quest Sprint](https://preview--skill-quest-sprint.lovable.app/)**: A platform for mastering new skills through 30-day guided sprints.

1.  **Artificial Assessment Intelligence for Educators (AAIE)**: Developing a custom-trained LLM to assist educators with AI-aware assessment design and feedback.
2.  **AI Assisted Navigation Device**: Prototyping an assistive device to improve mobility and accessibility for people with disabilities.
3.  **Venture Pipeline Management System**: Designing a system to help track and support the growth of inclusive businesses in Southeast Asia.
4.  **AI Organisation Design**: Exploring how AI can transform organizational workflows, with the goal of creating a next-generation AI-powered project planner.
